As for the exam editor button, pressing the button will lead you to a program developed for creating, editing exam for later use. 
There are 3 special features when using this exam editor:

* Custom: you will start with a blank exam and work your way up from there.

* Randomize: you will be asked for a number of question. After entering the number, the program will randomly pick questions from the database and import it into the exam.

* Open an existed exam: when you made an exam and you want to modify it, this is the option for that.

#### Exam marker:

Exam marker does not have a specific menu. When you choose this option, it will lead you straight to the Folder explorer for you to pick the folder that contains all the examinee's answers xml file. After that, it will go through every single file to mark them, temporarily save them then ask for a path to export those result into a txt file. This is an example of the file after being processed:
